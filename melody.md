### rhythmic variation
* Augmentation & Diminution
  + all notes are lengthened or shortened by the same ratio.
  + only specific note are lengthened or shortened.

* Metric Displacement
  - the motif moved so that it starts on a different beat in the meter.

* Time Signature Change
  - the motif is placed in a different time signature.

### melodic variation
* Sequencing
  - taking an entire motif and moving it either up or down in pitch 
    + Chromatically = shifting the pitches by the exact same interval
    + Diatonically = shifting the pitch but stay in the key.

* Melodic Inversion
  - flipping the original motif upside down (chromatically or diatonically)

* Retrograde
  - playing the motif backwards
    + Complete: completely backwards
    + Melodic: maintaining the original pitch order
    + Rhythmic: maintaining the original rhythmic order

* Fragmentation
  - the motif is broken down into smaller piece that can then be repeated, removed, or even modified to create new motivic statements
  - best used after a motif has had time to be established as important.

* Expansion & Contraction
  - the interval between two notes is increased or decreased
  - general rule: the larger the change the bigger the impact it will have on the personality of your motif!

* Embellishment & Reduction
  + Embellishment: additional note are added to the motif
    - Quantitative: none of the original note are moved, they all start on the exact same beat they originally started on.
    - Qualitative: additional notes can displace the starting point of the original notes.
  + Reduction: note are removed from the original notif

* Reconstruction
  - required that a motif first be "Reduced"
  - consists of adding new thing to a reduced motif to create an entirely new idea.

# How to Write Better Melodies

## Rhythm

Your melody should still sound good when played on only one pitch,

and the best way to do that is to ensure that your melody's rhythm balances repetition and variety and incluudes some syncopation.

## 246 Rule
Use the chord's 2nd, 4th and 6th note in the melody.

Everytime you these notes in your melody, You have 3 options:

1. Go down to the predictable harmonic note
2. Go up to the unpredictable harmonic note
3. Go somewhere completely different

The rule is to ensure that every melody includes the 2nd and 3rd options.

If you want your music appeal to a broader audience you should probably use the 1st option somewhere in your melody as well.

## Range

1. Determine the highest note in your melody,
    - one thought is to use your bass line's lowest note or at least one of its lowest notes.

2. Decide on what that note will actually be.
    - a good place to start is with the 3rd note in your chord (but not necessarily)

3. Determine the lowest note.
    - one suggest is to play your melody lowest note over your bass line's highest note or at least one of its highest note.

4. Create a flowing contour to join them up!
    - use large intervals very sparingly.
    - most of your melody use smaller intervals.

Your melody must have a big enough range to keep it interesting and full of life, but not too big so that it's hard to sing.

## Interval
Use at least one 6th or 7th interval in your melody

## Stepwise
Use no more than 3 stepwise note in your melody, unless for some good reason your really want that.
